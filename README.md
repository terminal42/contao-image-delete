# terminal42/contao-image-delete

This Contao extension overrides the default behaviour when deleting an image
in the Contao back end file manager. When deleting an image, users will
be promted with a list of preview images that match the current file name.

This allows to _safely_ delete an image including it's preview, e.g.
if necessary for legal reasons.

**Attention:** be aware that the new dialog will **only** appear for image
files. The distinction is pretty simple: if you click the delete button,
a regular file will show the known dialog if you _really want to delete_
the file. For image files, this popup won't appear but the user will be
redirected to the _safe-delete_ form.
